Mutagen – Program for point mutation simulation between homologous sequences

User edits two homologous sequences: first for descendent and second for parent organism. The program simulates random point mutations of parent sequence in order to achieve the descendent sequence and it counts: number of needed mutations, achieved synonym mutations, achieved stop codes and total number of attempts. A mutations is accepted when the same base with parent organism is obtained (which imitates the selection), as well as when synonym mutation is achieved, which is stored in a synonym sequence.
